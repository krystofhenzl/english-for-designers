# Voice & Tone


## Voice
If I should imagine myself as a persona I would like to be an "older brother". Someone cool and behave similarly to you however you can trust him in everything and he can give you helpful advice. Someone who isn't afraid to say you're doing something wrong and maybe you'll have a fight sometime but he always means well to you. It is the perfect combination of your best friend and your dad. I want my clients to think of me as an "older brother in design".

<ul>
  <li>Cool dude</li>
  <li>Helpful</li>
  <li>Completely honest</li>
</ul>

## Tone
I am trying to stay consistent and authentic across all my communications. Sometimes it could be a little problem (for example when you communicate in really serious matters) because my easy and friendly tone could look like I am a bit reckless. But people who know me like me as I am. So I will stay that friendly, confident, cool guy no matter what.

<ul>
  <li>Confident</li>
  <li>Friendly</li>
  <li>Funny</li>
</ul>

## Style
If you want to be on the same wavelength with me you have to:

<ul>
  <li>Do not be so serious</li>
  <li>Take it easy</li>
  <li>Sometimes use some terminology to make the communication more interesting</li>
   <li>Not be afraid to convince others otherwise</li>
  <li>Use memes and puns</li>
</ul>
