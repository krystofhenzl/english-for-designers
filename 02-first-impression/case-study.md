## Insight

Viola is interesting because <b>3 main pillars:</b>


1. Small and cozy space with specific architecture
2. Really famous actors for cheap prices
3. Great location in the centre of Prague

### First tries
At the beginning of the project we were a bit stuck with unique ideas. We tried for example wordclouds, atypic formats, blurry images... but these ideas did not work well but then we came up with <b>the concept of portals</b>

## The concept of portals

<b>Portals</b> - architectural element you can find all over the place. Portals fit perfect as our main visual key.

<b>Photos</b> - Portals and good photos of actors made a perfect combination of the insight pillars.

<b>Colors</b> - We kept the iconic purple color but we added beige color to have more options to operate with

<b>Typeface</b> - Font Roc Grotesk suited best for our purposes - Condensed styles for headlines, regular styles for text.

## How does it look today + Learnings

We won this tender and the implementation of this project is ongoing now.

The biggest learning for us was that even if we can not come up with something good for a long time we have to keep going and we will find it.

Also we learnt that making the project live could be really hard even the client loved it at first glance.
