# Divadlo Viola

## Background
Theatre Viola is a legendary and magical place in the heart of Prague. With over 60 years of history and specific space and architecture, it is one of the most iconic theatres in Prague. Viola is still quite popular, however, they are not popular with the younger target groups and one of the solutions could be the new visual identity. So Viola approached our school to help them with that. They wanted a new visual identity, social media strategy, website, and many more things.

### Goal of the project
Move this theatre to the modern age with new branding

### My team
Our team consisted of three graphic designers - Pavel Štutzbart, Jan Jursík, and me. Also, we cooperated with another team so the final product is a fusion of two cool ideas - one from us and the second from them.

### Role
Graphic designer | Ideamaker | Project manager 

### Dates
March 2022 - Present

## What it looked like
No one from the new managment of the Theatre knew why they have this logo and the visuals were very disjointed.

## Our approach

We created <b>3 main pillars</b> of Viola for ourselves:

1. Small and cozy space with specific architecture
2. Famous actors for cheap prices
3. Great location in the center of Prague

### First tries
At the beginning of the project, we were a bit stuck with unique ideas. We tried for example word clouds, atypic formats, and blurry images... but these ideas did not work well, but then we came up with <b>the concept of portals</b>

## The concept of portals
![Image showing the concept of portals](portal-concept.jpg)

<b>Portals</b> - an architectural element you can find all over the place. Portals fit perfectly as our primary visual key.

<b>Photos</b> - Portals and good photos of actors made a perfect combination of the insight pillars.

<b>Colors</b> - We kept the iconic purple color but we added beige color to have more options to operate with

<b>Typeface</b> - Font Roc Grotesk suited best for our purposes - Condensed styles for headlines, regular styles for text.


### Presentation for client
This is the presentation we presented to the client.

## How does it look today + Learnings

We won this tender and the implementation of this project is ongoing now.

The biggest learning for us was that even if we can not come up with something good for a long time we have to keep going and we will find it.

Also, we learned that making the project live could be hard even though the client loved it at first glance.
