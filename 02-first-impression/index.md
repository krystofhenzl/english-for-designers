## My background

![Krystof Henzl, night photo, staying in front of statue, looking cool](krystofhenzl.jpg)

I focus on design that is smart, clear, and working. My job is to help you sell your products, whatever they are.

Currently studying Graphic design at a university in Prague, also, I work at an agency called DDB FTW. But I have many other projects and one of them could be yours.

Besides my work life, I am an energetic guy interested in sports, technology, art, and a bit of gaming.
