# Year End Review

<h3>1) What did you like most about this course?</h3>
I like that the classes are not about grammar but it is more about really useful topics such as ability our work as good as possible.

<h3>2) What did you like least about this course?</h3>
I think that we spent too much time with presentations and abstracts. I would like to have the classes a bit more fast-paced.

<h3>3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How to do storytelling</li>
  <li>Many interesting topics from my classmate's stortytellings</li>
  <li>How to write better copy in English</li>

<h3>4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?</h3>
Probably some of the classmate's stortytellings - Max and the Importance of light in 3D, Petr and the Blue light and many more.
  
<h3>5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?</h3>
Probably my storytelling about AI. I think my classmates really learnt something out of it and that is something that makes me happy and proud.

<h3>6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?</h3>
I should stand by my work more and sell it better.

<h3>7) What’s one thing you could have done better?</h3>
Doing the assignments on time. I could imagine that it had to be very annoying for you when nobody came prepared to the class.

<h3>8) What’s one thing I could have done better?</h3>
I think we do not need to watch 30 minutes long videos. It would be better if you could present the topic to us in some more interactive way. Other than that I have nothing to say <3.

<h3>9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?</h3>
I think 3 hours lessons are just too much sometimes. I know it is not your fault but it will be cool if we have just like 2 hours but we will communicate more online and for example, we could present you our draft presentations on videocall or something like that.

<h3>10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?</h3>
Give feedback to your classmates, they will appreciate it, even though they say they do not!
