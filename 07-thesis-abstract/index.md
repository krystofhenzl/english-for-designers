This bachelor thesis delves into the concept of rebranding academic esports competitions, with a focus on the 3E Academic Championship, organized by the Czech Esports Association. The Championship was the first of its kind in Czechia, but with the rise in popularity of esports, other companies and organizations have started their academic competitions, leading to increased competition and a decline in the 3E Championship's relevance and fanbase.

This research aims to explore the benefits and challenges of rebranding the 3E Academic Championship. Including the development of a new image and identity that better resonates with its target audience and reflects the values and mission of the participating institutions. Through in-depth interviews with the organizers of the Championship and an analysis of other competitions, this study will identify key factors that contribute to successful rebranding efforts for academic esports competitions.

The findings of this research will inform a new rebranding strategy for the 3E Academic Championship, encompassing a new visual style and marketing approach, to increase participation and enhance its reputation within the esports community. This research offers valuable insights for academic institutions seeking to rebrand their esports competitions to maintain their relevance and engage with their audience effectively.
