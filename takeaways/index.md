# Takeaways

Five things I learned this semester in 2022:

1. Developed myslef into better designer because of interesting workshops and lectures
2. Text is a powerful tool. Copywriting is maybe even more important then the visual
3. GitHub, it is hard sometimes but I must admire it is really helpful.
4. I learned how I should write my bachelor thesis.
5. Track my time to be more productive.
