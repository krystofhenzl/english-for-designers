# Hi, I'm Kryštof

Hey!

My name is Kryštof. I am a graphic designer, specialized in online/social media/websites but do not get me wrong I can design you some print materials as well if you need (❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛).

Currently I study at University of Creative Communication in Prague. Also I work at agency, called DDB FTW. However I am open to any freelance job.  So check out my projects and hit me up!
