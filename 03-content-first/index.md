### Plain text about me

Hey!

My name is Kryštof. I am a graphic designer, specialized in online/social media/websites but do not get me wrong I can design you some print materials as well if you need ( ❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛). I focus on design that is smart, clear, and working. My job is to help you sell your products, whatever they are.

Currently I study at University of Creative Communication in Prague. Also I work at agency, called DDB FTW. However I am open to any freelance job. So check out my projects and hit me up!

Besides my work life, I am an energetic guy interested in sports, technology, art, and a bit of gaming.
